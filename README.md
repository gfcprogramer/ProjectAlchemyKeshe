# ProjectAlchemyKeshe

This project intent to create a faithfull keshe atomic carbon surface on a coin, in a simple pot.
The basic recipe is under.
Idea have one advance.
The water with dissolved sodium hidroxide is dropped into the glas.
The glass must have cooper vapour, and set to very high temperature.
If not we can use to place some surface of cooper and 1cm alum foil inside the glass.
This will be the starter. 
Is also possible to create using cooper powder 
Is semi-closed and set into a soft heat max 43 degree celsius.
The drops of sodium hidroxide will form the nano carbon layer.
The very high heat on glass, or taking the cooper foil and setting at fire, 
Will reduce back the oxide that forms.
The first rethorts was made out of ceramic.
The ceramic is full of minerals, cooper alum, and this set their resistance.
If we could set cooper oxide or cooper acetate over, and heat, it would crate with its vapour,
the metalic surface that will hold the nano-layer necessary.

Let the vapours form. The layers are formed.
When we let it expand into GANS?
we can set them. The layer is formed when in contact with soda hidroxide vapour.
We can set them wet. And the GANs begins to form.

In the middle ages there where no glass.
If they could create some surface, they would powder some gems.
We know that Stradivarius have by its mummification a surface of ruby.
Something there... something there..
Its all for today It hurts, I need rest..


Reflexion:
The oil it seems to me, to be a form of reduction of metal???. 
Yet I took its oil into a dry blob and from cooper was yet green (oxide?)
Whatever this means is probably not yet reduced back.
What is necessary to force metal reduction?
Reducing agent (wikipedya)
Hydrogen gas is a reducing agent when it reacts with non-metals...
and an oxidizing agent when it reacts with metals...












Recipe/Reflexion

The potassium hidroxide created from ash can facilitate its use.
We can use hidroxids and create the component on the fly.
we could also create hidrogen using 316l anomaly on pure water to build up
the proper tension in the hidrogem gas that will also create hidroxide on the fly in matter in vitro.

But the porpose is to instead create as simple as we can, as we can easy take the sodium hidroxide from ordinary soap?
By any means necessary, i know is possible to create similar elements using urine.
But for now a single drop of sodium hidroxide will be necessary. 
The eye protective glass, the gloves to work will be necessary while dealing with the contents.
We can use a simple 5 volt chinese cup heater. 
And conect them to a cellphone battery charger. 
This heat creates a form.
